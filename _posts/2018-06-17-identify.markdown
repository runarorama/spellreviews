[Identify](https://dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) is a 1st level divination spell from the Basic Rules. The spell is available to the [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/wizard) and [Bard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/bard), and automatically given to Clerics of the [Forge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/cleric#ForgeDomain) and [Knowledge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/cleric#KlowledgeDomain) domains.

## What does it do?

_Identify_ lets you immediately learn the properties of a magical item, or know what spells are affecting a creature or object.

It takes a minute to cast, and requires a one-time 100 gp investment for the material component, which the spell does not consume. It can be cast as a Ritual, so you can spend an additional ten minutes to cast it without expending a spell slot. If you're a wizard or bard, you don't need to have the spell prepared to cast it as a ritual. If you're a Forge or Knowledge domain cleric, Identify will be a domain spell, so you'll always have it prepared.

## Other ways to identify items

According to the Dungeon Master's Guide, [characters can identify a magic item by spending a short rest with it in their possession](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#IdentifyingaMagicItem). Potions can be identified simply by tasting them. This makes the utility of the _Identify_ spell a little less obvious.

However, _Identify_ works in eleven minutes (or one minute, at the cost of a spell slot) instead of an hour for a short rest. The spell can also identify things you can't identify by taking a rest. The spell can reveal the properties of basically anything that has been magically created or has a spell affecting it. For example, it can be used to identify a teleportation circle inscribed on the ground. You can also use _Identify_ to learn which spells are currently affecting a creature or object, if any.

## Conclusion

_Identify_ is a thoroughly useful utility spell, especially when cast as a ritual. You could cast _Identify_ on every object you encounter without expending a single spell slot. At least one person in your party should know this spell.
