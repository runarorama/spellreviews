It’s also available to Warlocks with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/warlock#PactOfTheFiend&quot;&gt;Pact of the Fiend&lt;/a&gt;. It takes an action to cast, and lets you choose to gain resistance to either fire or cold damage. Resistance means that damage of the type you choose is halved against you. In addition, while this spell is active, it deals 2d8 damage to any attackers that hit you with a melee attack, and they don’t get a saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spell can be cast only on yourself. The effect lasts for 10 minutes, which is 100 rounds of combat, and does not require concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, the damage this spell deals is of the opposite kind to the damage that it gives you resistance against. If you choose resistance to fire damage, the spell will deal cold damage to your attackers, and vice versa. Generally, creatures that deal fire damage will be resistant to fire and not cold. Some fire elementals for example are immune to fire damage and vulnerable to cold damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are lots of monsters resistant to both fire and cold damage. Many demons and devils are resistant to cold and immune to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compared-with-other-spells&quot;&gt;Compared with other spells&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-energy&quot;&gt;Protection from Energy&lt;/a&gt; is a 3rd level abjuration spell that also grants damage resistance, but does no damage and requires your concentration. &lt;em&gt;Protection from Energy&lt;/em&gt; can be cast on a creature other than yourself, and can grant resistance to acid, lightning, and thunder damage in addition to fire and cold. The duration is longer than &lt;em&gt;Fire Shield&lt;/em&gt; (up to one hour), although the duration can be cut short if you take damage and fail your concentration saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dndbeyond.com/spells/stone-skin&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stone Skin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another 4th level spell that grants damage resistance, albeit to far more common types of damage (nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing). Like &lt;em&gt;Protection from Energy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stone Skin&lt;/em&gt; deals no damage and requires concentration (up to 1 hour). &lt;em&gt;Stone Skin&lt;/em&gt; also costs 100 gp each time you cast it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Shield is a solid choice for going into battle with creatures that deal either fire or cold damage, or going into a situation where fire or cold is going to be an obstacle. The fact that it has no Concentration requirement makes this spell really strong. The damage-dealing aspect of it is less useful for glass cannons that stay out of melee range, but anything can happen in combat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fire Shield is a 4th level evocation spell for Wizards.

The spell is available to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/wizard&quot;&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/bard&quot;&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;, and automatically given to Clerics of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/cleric#ForgeDomain&quot;&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/cleric#KlowledgeDomain&quot;&gt;Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-do&quot;&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; lets you immediately learn the properties of a magical item, or know what spells are affecting a creature or object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a minute to cast, and requires a one-time 100 gp investment for the material component, which the spell does not consume. It can be cast as a Ritual, so you can spend an additional ten minutes to cast it without expending a spell slot. If you’re a wizard or bard, you don’t need to have the spell prepared to cast it as a ritual. If you’re a Forge or Knowledge domain cleric, Identify will be a domain spell, so you’ll always have it prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-ways-to-identify-items&quot;&gt;Other ways to identify items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Dungeon Master’s Guide, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/treasure#IdentifyingaMagicItem&quot;&gt;characters can identify a magic item by spending a short rest with it in their possession&lt;/a&gt;. Potions can be identified simply by tasting them. This makes the utility of the &lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; spell a little less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; works in eleven minutes (or one minute, at the cost of a spell slot) instead of an hour for a short rest. The spell can also identify things you can’t identify by taking a rest. The spell can reveal the properties of basically anything that has been magically created or has a spell affecting it. For example, it can be used to identify a teleportation circle inscribed on the ground. You can also use &lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; to learn which spells are currently affecting a creature or object, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; is a thoroughly useful utility spell, especially when cast as a ritual. You could cast &lt;em&gt;Identify&lt;/em&gt; on every object you encounter without expending a single spell slot. At least one person in your party should know this spell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Identify is a 1st level divination spell from the Basic Rules.

Your Ranger gets two 3rd level spell slots per long rest at 9th level. A that level, a Ranger can know a total of 6 spells, so you need to choose your spells carefully. Should you pick Lightning Arrow over other spells?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-lightning-arrow-do&quot;&gt;What does Lightning Arrow do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Arrow takes a bonus action to cast, and changes your next ranged weapon attack to deal lightning splash damage that works whether or not your attack hits. Every creature within 10 feet of the target (including allies) take 2d8 lightning damage, halved on a successful Dexterity saving throw. And instead of taking the normal damage from your weapon, the target of your attack takes 4d8 lightning damage, halved if you miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;statistical-analysis&quot;&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s analyze a scenario that might come up in the game. The 9th-level party is faced with eight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dire-wolf&quot;&gt;Dire Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the ranger’s turn. She decides to cast Lightning Arrow and attack one of the wolves with her Longbow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/direwolveslarrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ranger casts Lightning Arrow on a Dire Wolf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the ranger’s attack bonus is +8. Against the Dire Wolf’s AC of 14, she has a 3 in 4 chance of hitting the wolf with an arrow. She’ll do damage to the wolves in the blue area whether she hits or misses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all that into account, the spell will do an average of 16.5875 points of damage to the targeted dire wolf, and 5.5 to the others. The damage has the following probability distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/larrowhistogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lightning Arrow Damage Histogram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lightning-arrow-compared-with-other-spells&quot;&gt;Lightning Arrow compared with other spells&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other offensive spells available to the Ranger with 3rd level slots include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/conjure-barrage&quot;&gt;Conjure Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-wall&quot;&gt;Wind Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those deal 3d8 damage (piercing or bludgeoning, respectively) to creatures in a much larger area, although Lightning Arrow potentially has a much longer range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conjure Barrage is a 60 foot cone, which would allow our ranger to damage all eight of the dire wolves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/direwolvesbarrage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ranger casts Conjure Barrage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind Wall allows you to shape the 50 foot long wall to take pretty much any path you want up to 120 feet away. Here’s how that might look in our situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/direwolveswindwall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ranger casts Wind Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conjure Barrage and Wind Wall do more damage to more enemies, but Lightning Arrow does twice as much damage on average to a single enemy, which is generally more useful for a Ranger. The Ranger class is really optimized for taking down a single target at a time, so the AoE damage they can do is pretty feeble compared to the arcane casters. If a 9th-level party is going for AoE damage with 3rd-level spell slots, have the Wizards and Sorcerers bust out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball&quot;&gt;Fireballs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/barragevfireball.png&quot; alt=&quot;Conjure Barrage vs Fireball&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Arrow is very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hail-of-thorns&quot;&gt;Hail of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, which can be upcast with a 3rd level slot, dealing 3d10 damage to the target and everyone within 5 feet of it. The target also suffers the normal damage from the attack. Since this happens only if your attack hits, the damage output of Hail of Thorns is sometimes zero. Even so, Lightning Arrow does only a couple of points more damage on average (against a Dire Wolf, 16.6 vs 14.3). So all things being equal, Lightning Arrow is a slight upgrade from Hail of Thorns. Compare Hail of Thorns at 3rd level against the Dire Wolves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hailvlarrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hail of Thorns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully a quarter of the 3rd level slots used to cast Hail of Thorns in this situation would be completely wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-arrows&quot;&gt;Flame Arrows&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/pota&quot;&gt;Princes of the Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/xgte&quot;&gt;Xanathar’s Guide to Everything&lt;/a&gt;) is another 3rd level spell for the Ranger that could be compared to Lightning Arrow. Flame Arrows takes an action to cast, adds 1d6 damage to your next twelve attacks, and requires concentration the whole time. Using a single 3rd level slots for Flame Arrows ends up dealing maybe 4 points of damage more per turn on average over 6 turns than using that same slot for Lightning Arrow, but if the Ranger takes damage she might lose her concentration, turning those Flame Arrows into regular arrows again. So Flame Arrows is only better than Lightning Arrow in situations where you’re either fighting enemies vulnerable to fire, you know you’re going to have a drawn-out battle and you’re pretty sure you can shield your Ranger from taking damage, or if you’re up against a lot of enemies and you want to combine Flame Arrows with something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/classes/ranger#Hunter&quot;&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; archetype’s Volley feature, or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dndbeyond.com/spells/haste&quot;&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/larrowvfarrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lightning Arrow vs Flame Arrows&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enemy-damage-resistance-and-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Enemy damage resistance and vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 70 different creatures in the official D&amp;amp;D books are resistant to lightning damage, and more than 20 others are totally immune to it. However, many of those creatures have Good alignment, so are unlikely to be enemies in your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Arrow would be ridiculously good against creatures vulnerable to Lightning damage, but no creatures in the official D&amp;amp;D books so far have vulnerability to such damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare for creatures to be resistant to the magical piercing and bludgeoning damage of Wind Wall, Conjure Barrage, and Hail of Thorns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synergy-with-other-ranger-features&quot;&gt;Synergy with other Ranger features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very importantly, Lightning Arrow is an Attack, unlike Conjure Barrage or Wind Wall. Since it’s an Attack, it synergizes nicely with the Archery fighting style, your Extra Attack feature, the Hunter archetype’s animal companion, the Gloom Stalker’s Dread Ambusher and Stalker’s Flurry features, the Horizon Walker’s Planar Warrior and Distant Strike features, as well as the Hunter’s Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, and Horde Breaker features. Although Lightning Arrow only augments a single attack, these features allow you to make additional attacks either before or after your Lightning Arrow, or add more damage dice to the spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the total damage output of a 9th-level Ranger’s turn when casting Lightning Arrow looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/larrowdpr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ranger DPR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-hits&quot;&gt;Critical Hits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Conjure Barrage, Hail of Thorns, or Wind Wall, Lightning Arrow can benefit from a critical hit. This means that 5% of the time the damage to the target will be 8d8. The splash damage will still be be 2d8. If you average the critical hits over all your uses of Lightning Arrow, it amounts to an additional 2 points of damage per casting. That’s not a lot, but when you do get those critical hits they may turn the tide in any given fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compared-with-other-classes&quot;&gt;Compared with other classes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 9th level, the Wizard has access to a 5th level spell slot, letting them cast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cone-of-cold&quot;&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, a 60-foot cone dealing 8d8 damage. But Lightning Arrow is a 3rd level spell, so let’s compare it with the Wizard’s 3rd level spells. Fireball does 8d6 damage in a 20-foot radius sphere, making Lightning Arrow seem pretty feeble by comparison on its own. That said, you’ll usually be casting Lightning Arrow as part of a combination with multiple attacks on your turn–something that the Wizard cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/larrowdprvfireball.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lightning Arrow DPR vs Fireball&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-would-use-this-spell&quot;&gt;When you would use this spell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Arrow is a situational combat spell. It’s good for when you want to deal a lot of damage to a single enemy with its allies nearby, or when you might want to prepare an ambush. The saving throw is Dex, which a lot of creatures that fight in close formation might be fairly good at. Since this spell’s splash damage doesn’t discriminate between friend and foe, it’s less useful if your allies are already engaging the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning Arrow is a strong offensive spell for the mid-tier ranger, similar to Hail of Thorns, but slightly better. It seems somewhat underpowered when you analyze it on its own, but it synergizes well with the class’s other features. It’s probably the best damage-dealing 3rd-level spell available to the ranger.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Lightning Arrow is a 3rd level Ranger spell from the Player’s Handbook.
